I'm Thaísa Elvas and here are some curiosities about me:

- 📚 I participated in a Back-End Developer Bootcamp at {Reprograma} in 2020
- 🎲 Now I'm participating in a Data Engineer Bootcamp sponsored by Santander (Santander Coders)
- :mortar_board: I graduated in 2022 as a Chemistry Engineer at UFPE
- 🎵 I like playing the guitar, and singing and dream of playing the piano someday
- 😄 I'm a curious person, who loves to learn, go to the beach, run, go hiking, make real connections and meet good people :)
- And I love to code ❤️
