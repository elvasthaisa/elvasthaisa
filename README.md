I'm Thaísa Elvas and here are some curiosities about me:

- 💻 I work at Inclusio as a QA Tester, but I also worked there as a Front-End developer for 7 months :)
- 📚 I participated in a Back-End Developer bootcamp at {Reprograma}
- :mortar_board: I graduated in 2022 as a Chemistry Engineer at UFPE.
- 🎵 I like playing guitar, singing and I dream about playing piano someday.
- 😄 I'm a curious person, who loves to learn, to go to the beach, to run, to do hikings, to make real connections and meet good people :)
- And I love to code ❤️
